# Empirical Validations
How can we empirically validate the models, for instance with social network data. Hard to find good variables. Write an application for facebook? Okcupid would have a lot of this data, but again, most of it is not time depenedent. Maybe we could ask them for it.

# Opinions and Politics
Is it possible to model opinions as hidden variables. For instance, characterize a players political orientation from 0 to 1 with 0=Left Wing, 1=Right Wing. Based on his opinion to certain questions.

# Spins in N dimensions
The more spins align the more they agree.

# Consensus
Why is consensus important? It is very unlikely in a democratic process only 50% is needed. Some parliaments require a two thirds majority. Why do we care about consensus, especially in large populations? Isn't diversity also important? Can opinion formation help understand the messy nature of the democratic process? Why is it always so close to 50% on either side.

# Noise
Why is there no noise in many cases (in contrast to EGT for example).
