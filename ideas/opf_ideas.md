# Ideas on OF
Pretty random collection on things popping in my head when going through the existing subject literature.

## Empirical Validations
How can we empirically validate the models, for instance with social network data. Hard to find good variables. Write an application for facebook? Okcupid would have a lot of this data, but again, most of it is not time depenedent. Maybe we could ask them for it.

## Opinions and Politics
Is it possible to model opinions as hidden variables. For instance, characterize a players political orientation from 0 to 1 with 0=Left Wing, 1=Right Wing. Based on his opinion to certain questions.

In my (Wu) opinion, democratic election is the best source of data to validate opinion formation model: the opinions are mutually exclusive; there are huge incentives for people to interact with each other (it concerns important public issues). 

On the contrary, the choice of operating systems is a suboptimal choice. There are people who use all 3 major OS. The 3 operating systems target different people. Some OS can do sth that no other OSes can do. For example, if one is going to play a lot of classic and new computer games, then Windows is the only choice. For the incentives of interactions? One may not care so much with what OS other people are using. One can install Linux on the same machine with no charges, so "switching to Linux" is not exactly the same as "switching to Windows". Mac OS is even tied to the machine one buys. Anyway, it's a mess.

## Spins in N dimensions
The more spins align the more they agree.

## Consensus
Why is consensus important? It is very unlikely in a democratic process only 50% is needed. Some parliaments require a two thirds majority. Why do we care about consensus, especially in large populations? Isn't diversity also important? Can opinion formation help understand the messy nature of the democratic process? Why is it always so close to 50% on either side.

The problems of consensus and diversity are one in the same, if one models diversity as the lack of consensus. The timescale of the formation of consensus is a quantity of interest. Although in many cases, the state of consensus is the only absorbing state, i.e. consensus is inevitable, the convergence time can be so long that it is infeasible in real life. Diversity in real life can be an indication that the timescale for consensus is very long. 

## Noise
Why is there no noise in many cases (in contrast to EGT for example).
